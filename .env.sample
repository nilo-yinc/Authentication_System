# what happend , and where was wrong tell me what you corrected

# Task Completed
# The application was initially unable to start due to a series of issues:

# MongoDB Connection String: The password in the .env file contained an @ symbol, which needed to be URL encoded as %40 to avoid confusion in the connection string. This was corrected to:

# MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://admin:admin%40123@cluster0.7rxx3.mongodb.net/cohort
# Module Not Found Error: The application was trying to import routes from ./routes/user.js, but the correct file was user.routes.js. This was updated in index.js to:

# import userRoutes from "./routes/user.routes.js";
# Route Definition Error: In user.routes.js, the route was incorrectly defined using Router.length. This was corrected to use the router instance:

# router.post("/register", registerUser);
# After making these corrections, the application was able to start successfully, connect to MongoDB, and listen on port 3000 without errors
